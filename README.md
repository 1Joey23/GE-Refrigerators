Hello User! 
Thanks for taking the time to view my webpage! I made this webpage for my Web Design final project.
It is a business page dedicated to general electric refridgerators.
This webpage includes fetures such as a dark theme button, Javascript timer for the sale, 
a fully responsive layout with css, print functionality for one of the pages using print css styling,
and numerous HTML and CSS elements. This webpage was made before I learned form processers so the form
at the bottom of the page doesn't sent the input data anywhere. Anyways, thanks for looking at my page!
It was a very funny/interesting project.
